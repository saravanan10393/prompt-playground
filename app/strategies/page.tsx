                  Zero-shot prompting means giving the AI clear, direct instructions without providing any examples.
                  It&apos;s the simplest and most straightforward approach - you tell the AI exactly what you want,
                  and it delivers based purely on its training.

                  ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) combines reasoning traces with task-specific actions. The AI alternates between

                  Meta prompting assigns the AI a specific expert role or persona tailored to your task. By defining who
                  the AI should &quot;be&quot; (e.g., a marketing strategist, senior developer, or financial advisor), you help it
                  access the most relevant knowledge and adopt the appropriate perspective and communication style.
